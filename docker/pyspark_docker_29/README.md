# PySpark - Data transformations in pyspark

## Introduction
#### Data transformation is a fundamental task in any data analysis or processing pipeline. In the realm of big data processing, Apache Spark has emerged as a powerful framework for handling large-scale data processing tasks efficiently. When it comes to transforming data within Spark, developers often have to choose between Spark's native functions, User-Defined Functions (UDFs), and Pandas UDFs.
