Overview
========

This project was generated after ran 'astro dev init' using the Astronomer CLI.

Project Contents
================

Your Astro project contains the following files and folders:

- dags: This folder contains the Python files for your Airflow DAGs.

Deploy Your Project Locally
===========================

Start Airflow on your local machine by running 'astro dev start'.

This command will spin up five Docker containers on your machine, each for a different Airflow component:

- Postgres: Airflow's Metadata Database
- Scheduler: The Airflow component responsible for monitoring and triggering tasks
- DAG Processor: The Airflow component responsible for parsing DAGs
- API Server: The Airflow component responsible for serving the Airflow UI and API
- Triggerer: The Airflow component responsible for triggering deferred tasks

When all five containers are ready the command will open the browser to the Airflow UI at http://localhost:8080/. You should also be able to access your Postgres Database at 'localhost:5432/postgres' with username 'postgres' and password 'postgres'.
