    "## Optimizing our bike rental business - ETL pipeline\n",
    "Our fictional company operates bike rental stations across the city. The primary goal of this data pipeline is to transform raw operational data—such as ride logs, maintenance records, and weather information—into a structured and refined format, enabling comprehensive analytics. <br/>\n",
    "This allows us to track key business metrics like total revenue, forecast future earnings, understand revenue contributions from members versus non-members, analyze customer behavior and lifetime value, and crucially, identify and quantify revenue loss due to maintenance issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "By providing these insights, the pipeline empowers us to optimize operations, improve bike availability, and ultimately maximize profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using as input a raw dataset containing information coming from our ride tracking system as well as data from our maintenence system, weather data, and customer CDC events. Our goal is to ingest this data in near real time and build table for our analyst team while ensuring data quality.\n",
