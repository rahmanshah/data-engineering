    "## The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s competitive market, efficiently managing the sales pipeline is crucial across industries. Ineffective sales pipeline management can lead to missed opportunities, inaccurate revenue forecasting, and poor resource allocation. Organizations without a comprehensive data intelligence platform often struggle to consolidate data from multiple sources, deliver real-time insights to stakeholders, and reduce time-to-insights necessary for strategic adjustments in the sales process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks' Intelligence Platform leverages **AI and Business Intelligence (or as we call it, AI/BI)** to provide seamless access to your organization's sales data. By integrating data from various CRM, marketing, and transactional sources into a unified environment, Databricks breaks down data silos and offers end-to-end visibility into the entire sales pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced AI-driven analytics and intuitive BI tools empower both technical and non-technical users to examine sales trends, forecast revenue, and analyze pipeline health through natural language queries. This accessibility accelerates time-to-insights, enhances cross-functional collaboration, and enables leadership to make informed, data-driven decisions to improve sales strategy, close rates, and overall pipeline efficiency.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the following sections, this notebook will guide you through at a high level:\n",
    "1. Data Ingestion with **Lakeflow Connect**\n",
    "2. Data Governance and Security with **Unity Catalog**\n",
    "3. Creating Interactive **Dashboards** with Databricks\n",
