      "|13913|Holiday London DB Room Let-on going|Michael      |My girlfriend and I hadn't known Alina before we took the leap of faith to rent her flat. Alina just couldn't be nicer! Her flat is comfortable, homey, very sunny, and quiet at night. Her diverse neighborhood rocks! It's full of excellent eateries of varying ethnicities, good supermarkets, etc., etc. Her place is about a 10-minute walk to the Finsbury Park tube stop, and there are also several buses that ply Stroud Green Road. The Piccadilly and Victoria tube lines that serve Finsbury Park are very dependable and come frequently. My only caveat is if you are unwilling to take 20- to 40-minute commutes to downtown London attractions and money is no object, you will prefer to stay downtown. But for anyone else, you will love your experience of living in a real, untouristy neighborhood and dealing with a generous, warm-hearted woman I'm happy to call a new friend.|\n",
