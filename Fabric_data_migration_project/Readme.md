In this project, we migrate data from one lakehouse to another lakehouse amd data warehouse using data pipeline where we use metadata activity to get data about data intend to migrate, lookup activity for query data warehouse table to see the files we intend to migrate already been tranferrerd or needs to transfer, then we use filter activity to filter out the files based on lookup activity query results with metadata results, then we use foreach activity to migrate files one by one with two copy activity and a script activity which runs upon successful ingestion of files data to warehoues table.
